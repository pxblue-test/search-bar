# Search-bar
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/pxblue/search-bar/tree/angular.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/pxblue/search-bar/tree/angular)


This is a sample application showing how to build a basic Search-bar. At the top of the page, the app bar has a search icon on the right. After clicking on the search icon, the search bar slides in from the right of the app bar.

## Running the example
To run this example, first clone the repository. Each of our example projects comes with a branch for Angular and a branch for React. You can choose which branch to use when you clone the repository (or you can switch after cloning as well):

```
git clone https://github.com/pxblue/search-bar -b angular
git clone https://github.com/pxblue/search-bar -b react
```

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies (note: our projects are set up to be run with yarn):

```
cd search-bar
yarn
```

You can then run the example - this will launch the application in your browser:
```
yarn start
```

All of our code examples can also be found on [Stackblitz](http://www.stackblitz.com/@px-blue), which allows you to make changes to a project and see the updates to the rendered application in real-time.
